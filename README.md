# Nakano's Server Mod
This mod was built specially for the free server I got from Bisect Hosting.
The modifications done by this mod will only take effect when playing on multiplayer, or server side.

It makes so:
-It's not possible to build or destroy tiles on the surface.
-Be able to cutdown trees and have them replant instantly.
-Be able to place platforms and torches on the surface, where there isn't a house.
-Free building and mining on the underground and ahead.
-Bombs have no effect on background walls, and will only damage tiles on the underground.
-Some tiles like life crystal, jars and other things respawn overtime.
-The Dungeon monsters and Skeletron are harder and tougher.
-Chests are refilled with loot every 1 hour.
-The dungeon is resetted to their pre-skeletron kill state every 2 hours.

Don't steal the mod scripts. If you want to try making a server mod based on this, reach me first.

Without Bisect Hosting, this server wasn't possible.

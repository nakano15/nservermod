# Nakano's Server Mod
This mod was built specially for the free server I got from Bisect Hosting.
The modifications done by this mod will only take effect when playing on multiplayer, or server side.

It makes so: <br>
-It's not possible to build or destroy tiles on the surface. <br>
-Be able to cutdown trees and have them replant instantly. <br>
-Be able to place platforms and torches on the surface, where there isn't a house. <br>
-Free building and mining on the underground and ahead. <br>
-Bombs have no effect on background walls, and will only damage tiles on the underground. <br>
-Some tiles like life crystal, jars and other things respawn overtime. <br>
-The Dungeon monsters and Skeletron are harder and tougher. <br>
-Chests are refilled with loot every 1 hour. <br>
-The dungeon is resetted to their pre-skeletron kill state every 2 hours.

Don't steal the mod scripts. If you want to try making a mod based on this, reach me first.

The mod has support to Hero's Mod. Giving the permission of "Allow World Building", allows characters to build on the surface.
Use that wiselly.

If you want to enable being able to fight the Wall of Flesh, you will need to remove the script disabling it on NpcMod.cs.
That will require that you be able to compile a mod, though.

Without Bisect Hosting partnership, this mod woudln't exist.<br>
If you want to get them to host a server for you, you can get 25% off on your first month by

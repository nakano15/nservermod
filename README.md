# Nakano's Server Mod
This mod was built specially for the free server I got from Bisect Hosting.
The modifications done by this mod will only take effect when playing on multiplayer, or server side.

It makes so: <br>
-It's not possible to build or destroy tiles on the surface. <br>
-Be able to cutdown trees and have them replant instantly. <br>
-Be able to place platforms and torches on the surface, where there isn't a house. <br>
-Free building and mining on the underground and ahead. <br>
-Bombs have no effect on background walls, and will only damage tiles on the underground. <br>
-Some tiles like life crystal, jars and other things respawn overtime. <br>
-The Dungeon monsters and Skeletron are harder and tougher. <br>
-Chests are refilled with loot every 1 hour. <br>
-The dungeon is resetted to their pre-skeletron kill state every 2 hours.

Don't steal the mod scripts. If you want to try making a mod based on this, reach me first.

Without Bisect Hosting partnership, this mod woudln't exist. Sadly it didn't worked.
